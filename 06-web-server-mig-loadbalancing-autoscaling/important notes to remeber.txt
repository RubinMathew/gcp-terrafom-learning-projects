# you cannot install apache2 using start up script if your vm instance does not have external ip address.
# if you create MIG without acces config (ip) your appache wont be installed and your load balaner will be failed

To check whether your autoscaler works or not you need to do follwoing things 

for generating cpu usage 
ssh into one of the vm and
> sudo apt-get install -y stress-ng               # For Debian/Ubuntu
> stress-ng --cpu 1 --timeout 300s            this will generate stress for 300 sec

now you can see that another MIG instances will be generated automattically and your services won't be stopped.load balancer will redirect traffic to your new instances.
